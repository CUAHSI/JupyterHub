# CUAHSI JupyterHub

The CUAHSI JupyterHub is a web application that allows HydroShare users to execute scientific code in the cloud. It’s hosted on the Google Cloud Platform and is maintained by the CUAHSI Compute staff. While this application supports the execution of a variety of codes, it’s primarily designed to write, build, and run Jupyter Notebooks.

> The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more. - Project Jupyter

A Jupyter notebook is thus an enhanced computational environment that combines rich text and code execution into a single script-like container. The CUAHSI JupyterHub combines this functionality with the HydroShare data repository to provide a rich computational environment for water scientists.

The CUAHSI JupyterHub is hosted on the Google Cloud Platform and has been carefully designed to provide maximum interoperability with the HydroShare data repository. It offers free, limited computational resources primarily aimed at education and reproducible science.
