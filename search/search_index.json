This new feature allows you to create custom environments that capture software dependencies of unique use cases that will persist between sessions. The following steps demonstrate how to create a persistent virtual environment. Launch a terminal within your JupyterHub instance. Create a new Anaconda virtual environment using the command below, making sure to install the \u201cipykernel\u201d library. Once successfully created, you should see instructions for activating and deactivating the environment: This new environment is saved in data/conda-envs and will persist between JupyterHub sessions. This means that next time you come back, your Anaconda environment will exist. To use this environment you may need to click the refresh button in the JupyterLab toolbar. You should be able to create new notebooks with this custom environment from the Launcher panel, e.g. clicking on the icon showing \u201cconda env:test-env\u201d.

Group membership limits system interruptions and ensures that resources are effectively curated and managed. When first accessing the application, you will be directed to the CUAHSI JupyterHub Group landing page. Request to join the group, and after admission has been granted you will be able to access the computational environment. To expedite the approval process, please ensure that your HydroShare user profile is complete and up-to-date. Contact help@cuahsi.org if you have any questions regarding this process. Launching JupyterHub There are multiple ways to access the CUAHSI JupyterHub platform which are listed below. All of these methods require that you register your HydroShare account with the CUAHSI JupyterHub Group (see Gaining Access ) HydroShare Web Application The simplest way to get started with the CUAHSI JupyterHub is by launching it directly from the HydroShare Apps library ( hydroshare.org/apps ) by clicking on the CUAHSI JupyterHub icon. This redirect you to the CUAHSI JupyterHub server where you will be asked to login using your HydroShare credentials. Once authenticated, you will be asked to choose a Profile Environment which will be used to launch an isolated cloud computing environment for you to work in. In this space, you can create files and execute code from within your web browser. Any data you upload, download, and create is associated with your HydroShare account and will persist between sessions, meaning that it will be there next time you log in. Prior to gaining access, you will be asked join the CUAHSI JupyterHub HydroShare group (see the Access and Authentication section for details). HydroShare Open-With Menu Another common way of accessing the CUAHSI JupyterHub environment is by using the HydroShare Open with functionality. This button can be found in the top right corner of any HydroShare resource landing page. After selecting \"CUAHSI JupyterHub\", a computing environment will be prepared and the content of the current HydroShare resource will be placed inside of it. This is a convenient method for executing code, data, and workflows that have been published in the HydroShare repository.

The application enables you to easily download and open HydroShare resources, edit files in Jupyter, and synchronize changes with HydroShare. Visit the software's GitHub repository for configuration, installation, and other information. User Documentation The main resource view displays HydroShare resources that your user account can edit. Here, you can sort by resource title, creator, creation date, and last modified date. Browse a resource's files by clicking on it's title. Use the checkboxes to the left of resource titles' to select and download entire resources. Resources can be re-downloaded, however all files within the local copy of the resource will be overwritten. The resource entity view displays a resource's files and folders. Double click on a folder to navigate within it; Use the upward pointing arrow in the upper left corner to navigate up a level in the directory tree. To go back to the resource view, select Resources in the upper right corner. Icons to the left of entities (files and folders) show their sync status. There are four icons: HS, , , and . HS denotes that a file is on HydroShare and has not been downloaded locally. denotes that a file is only on the local filesystem and not on HydroShare. denotes that a file is in-sync with HydroShare, meaning it is the same both locally and on HydroShare. Lastly, denotes that a file is out-of-sync with HydroShare, meaning the file is on HydroShare but differs from the local version. To download/upload one or more entities, select them with a single click. Notice in the upper right corner, the download and upload files buttons become tappable. Once you've selected the entities, tap on the desired action. A toast will be displayed from the upper right corner displaying the result of the action.
